# Fleapit

http://www.fleapit.net/

## Description
Cross-breed between Ebay, Tinder and a traditional flea-market, but non-monetary. The focus is to create a platform where users can exchange things they have at home with items of other users with an equivalent value range. The user registers on Fleapit, adds a first item and starts swiping left (dislike) or right (like) on other users’ objects based on a similar value. When two users like each other’s items a match happens and a chat becomes accessible to accept or not the trade.

## Technology
Fleapit uses Ruby on Rails, JS, Heroku, postgresql, and Cloudinary to store images.
